such quarter, indicating the amount of the benefit increase to be

the cost of such increase would be met by an increase in the contribution

is also a cost-of-living computation quarter, the Commissioner shall
publish in the Federal Register within 45 days after the close of
such quarter a determination that a benefit increase is resultantly
required and the percentage thereof. The Commissioner shall also publish
in the Federal Register at that time (i) a revision of the range of
the primary insurance amounts which are possible after the application
of this subsection based on the dollar amount specified in subparagraph
(C)(i) of subsection (a)(1) (with such revised primary insurance amounts
constituting the increased amounts determined for purposes of such
subparagraph (C)(i) under this subsection), or specified in subsection
(a)(3) as in effect prior to 1979, and (ii) a revision of the range
of maximum family benefits which correspond to such primary insurance
amounts (with such maximum benefits being effective notwithstanding
section 203(a)  except for paragraph (3)(B) thereof (or paragraph (2) thereof as
in effect prior to 1979)). Notwithstanding the preceding sentence,
such revision of maximum family benefits shall be subject to paragraph
(6) of section 203(a)  (as added by section 101(a)(3) of the Social Security Disability
Amendments of 1980<sup><a class="ssact" href="https://www.ssa.gov/OP_Home/ssact/title02/0215.htm#ft236" name="ftn236" title="Footnote #236">[236]</a></sup>).</p>

subsection (a) does not apply in any year by reason of paragraph (4)(B)
of that subsection (but the application of this subsection in such
cases shall be modified by the application of subdivision (I) in the
last sentence of paragraph (4) of that subsection)), except that for
this purpose, in applying paragraphs (2)(A)(ii), (2)(D)(iv), and (2)(D)(v)
of this subsection as in effect in December 1978, the phrase “increased to the next higher multiple of $0.10” shall be deemed
to read “decreased to the next lower multiple of $0.10”. For purposes of computing primary insurance amounts and maximum
family benefits (other than primary insurance amounts and maximum
family benefits for individuals to whom such paragraph (4)(B) applies),
the Commissioner of Social Security shall revise the table of benefits
contained in subsection (a), as in effect in December 1978, in accordance
with the requirements of paragraph (2)(D) of this subsection as then
in effect, except that the requirement in such paragraph (2)(D) that
the Commissioner of Social Security publish such revision of the table

such subsequent year, the Commissioner shall reduce such applicable
